    <h1>Welcome to My Projects</h1>
    <marquee>Hi, I'm R C James. Welcome to my fun hobby projects page!</marquee>
    <p>I'm a dual student working at Sanofi. I'm a bioinformatician with experience in R and Python, and especially in chemoinformatics modules like RDKit. I'd like to make a web game someday, and that's what this site will be for. It'll catalogue my journey into web development (I'm completely inexperienced) and hopefully it'll serve as my portfolio.</p>
    <p>Everything here is broken right now, but cool stuff will be here eventually :)</p>
