This is the repository for my personal website. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website is a simple static website that will hopefully contain some of my fun learning projects and other stuff that I find interesting. I'm learning as I go, so it's a work in progress.
